1. Class Stopwatch
2. Two Methods: Start and Stop
3. Calling Methods: Start first and Stop next
4. Stopwatch duration: TimeSpan value display on console
5. Use Stopwatch multiple times.
	a. Start & Stop
	b. Start & Stop
	c. Calculate TimeSpan each time
6. A Stopwatch SHOULD NOT START Twice in a ROW. And throw "InvalidOperationException" Error.

Goals:
1. Class is always in valid state
2. Use Encapsulation (Hiding the workings)
